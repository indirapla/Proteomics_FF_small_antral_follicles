# Proteomics_characterization. Follicular fluid from ovarian small antral follicles (hSAF)
This repository contains R code used to perform the data analysis descrived in the manuscript:

### Proteome of fluid from human ovarian small antral follicles reveals insights in folliculogenesis and oocyte maturation. https://doi.org/10.1093/humrep/deaa335

#### File: one-way repeated measurement ANOVA.R
To assess whether there were differences at protein level between FF that surrounded oocytes that matured or remained immature, a sparse partial least squares discriminant analysis (sPLS-DA) (Chung and Keles, 2010) was performed using ‘mixOmics’ R package.
